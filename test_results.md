### Test Case: HIGH MOTIVATION - Divorce + Financial Distress

**Input Transcript:**
```
Agent: Hi, thanks for reaching out. Tell me about your property and situation.

Seller: Hi, yes, we need to sell our house at 456 Oak Street. We're going through a divorce and it's been really stressful. We're behind on two mortgage payments and honestly just want to get this resolved quickly.

Agent: I understand that must be difficult. What's your timeline looking like?

Seller: We need to close as soon as possible, ideally within 30 days. The house needs some work - the roof has a few leaks and the HVAC is old - but we can't afford to fix anything right now. We're just overwhelmed.

Agent: What kind of offers would you consider?

Seller: We're very flexible. We just want a cash offer and a quick close. We'll sell it as-is, no repairs needed. We're tired of dealing with this and just want to move on with our lives.

Agent: Have you talked to any other buyers?

Seller: We had it listed with a realtor but the listing expired. We're done waiting. We just need someone who can close quickly and take this burden off our hands.

Agent: Are both of you in agreement on selling?

Seller: Yes, absolutely. We both just want this done. Whatever it takes to close fast and split the proceeds. This has been a nightmare and we're desperate to move forward.
