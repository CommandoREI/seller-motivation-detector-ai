  "full_text": "Hello, this is David. Hello, David. Yeah. This is Shannon. Shannon Mack. I'm returning your call. Oh, super. Yeah. Let's see. I just messaged you a short time ago, right? Yeah. Okay, cool. Are you actually calling about one of your properties or a property that you have? It is my home. Okay. Is that the one on Princeton Street? Yes, it is. Okay, super. Yeah, I'm really familiar with that area. I'm just across the way over here in Coeur d'Alene. What's going on, Shannon, with your property? What prompted you to call me back? Well, I'm in a bit of a bind. I am in foreclosure. I'm a little bit behind in payments. And I'm not sure what I'm going to do about it. Okay. Well, first of all, I'm glad you called. And I want you to know that you made a good decision in calling because I work with a lot of people in your situation. And it is more common than you think. So I'm here to help and we're going to figure out what we can do. Does that sound good? Okay. Okay. So, first question, and this is an important one. Do you have a foreclosure sale date? Do you know? Yes, I got the notice. When is the date? It's August. August 17th. August 17th. Okay. And have you worked with the bank at all? Have you talked to the bank at all? Tried to figure something out with them? Well, I'm recently divorced. So there's a little bit of difference in the money that comes in. Gotcha. So is that why you got behind? Is it because you ended up with a divorce? Right. Okay. And what's the situation like? How many months late are you right now? I'm pretty far behind. So, like six months? Three months? No, nine months. Okay. Nine months. And do you know about how much you owe in back amount, in back payments? Well, I know I owe a lot. And I know that they also charge interest. And I know there's attorney fees. And I know I have penalties. I think, you know, it's $24,030 is what they say I owe. And then there's all these other payments on top of that with interest and penalties. Okay. So about $24,000 in payments. And then you get the penalties and interest and all that on top of that, right? Yeah. All the other things they add on. Okay. And so you said you had talked with the bank or no? And trying to figure something out with them? No. You have not. Okay. So have they tried to call you? Have they sent you letters? Obviously, you got a letter probably from a trustee, right? That said the sale date. And I know those are surprising to get. But have you had any other communication other than getting that notice? Well, I didn't open any of the letters from the bank. Okay. No, that's pretty common. I don't blame you there. What is owed on the mortgage still besides those back payments? What is owed on that mortgage? The bank. Yeah. What's owed to the bank? It's $192,000. Okay. And is that the only mortgage on the property? Just that first mortgage? Yeah. Plus the back payments. Okay. And so that's just like a regular conventional mortgage. It's not like an arm or anything like that? No, it's a regular. Okay. All right. So you owe about $192,000. And you have roughly $30,000 in back payments and fees and all of that good stuff. Do you know what the property is worth in great condition? I don't know what condition it's in. But in great condition, what would that property be worth? Well, the neighbor's house sold recently. And it's just a little bit smaller than mine. And it was $330,000. So I'm thinking at least $330,000. Okay. Is the neighbor's house same bedroom, same baths within a few blocks away? Right. It's just down the street. Okay. Same block. All right. Okay. Does your property need repairs? Well, we do need a new water heater. And the one bathroom, really, it had a leak. Did that leak cause any damage? Yeah. Around the tub at the faucet area. So I had that repaired. But the tiles never replaced. And the tub's old and ugly anyway. Okay. And then there's two windows that don't work at all. And they're all frosted over. The insulation's gone. Okay. Anything else? Well, a couple of the appliances really aren't that great. They're kind of old. The stove and the fridge. Okay. Okay. Okay. Super. Well, you know, I understand your situation. And your sale date's coming up on, what was that date? The 17th, right? 17th of August? It is the 17th. So we're kind of getting pressured for time here. We're down to weeks at this point. Do you have an alternative? Are you planning to go somewhere else? Do you have a backup if something doesn't work out? Not at the moment. No, I really don't. Okay. I'm not sure what I'm going to do. Okay. So, ideally, what would be a great outcome for you? If we could help you put something together, would you, would a good outcome be selling the property, avoiding the foreclosure, being able to forget about the $30,000 in back payments and start fresh? I mean, would that be a good option for you? Well, I've been thinking about it and I really, I do need to move on and I don't want this to be, you know, forever hanging over my credit. And I just kind of want to get things cleaned up and taken care of and, and start over. Yep. Understand. I, a little, little personal story. I had my own bankruptcy in a bankruptcy and foreclosure in 2001. So it was a while ago, but it really messed things up for a long time. And took me about six, six years to be able to get another house. And so I know that the bankruptcy was horrible on my credit, but the foreclosure might've been even worse because it was just, it, it took me seven years and work on my credit to get that thing off of my credit and trying to get anything done, trying to rent a house, trying to definitely buy a house. And they, you know, they ask, have you ever, have you ever, you know, been foreclosed? Yes. And, oh my gosh, all of a sudden, you know, the judge, you know, they're judgmental and it's really hard to get anything done. So ideally it's so much better to get something done before that happens. So you don't end up with that foreclosure on your credit for all of those years. So that's, that's one of the reasons I'm really passionate about helping people because I know, I know what it's like, you know, I've been there, I've had that foreclosure and it just, it was not fun. So if, if I could step in and either make those back payments up and you know, take the property off of your hands. So you wouldn't have to worry about the foreclosure or just buy the house outright from you before the foreclosure. You wouldn't have to worry about the foreclosure on your credit. Like I said, that, you know, 30 ish thousand dollars in back payments. I mean, you could forget about that. It wouldn't be looming over your head anymore. What, what would you need to get started again? You know, obviously you're not going to go buy a house right now. You're going to need to rent for a while. And I can also help you with some credit repair ideas. I know a couple of great companies because I work with them because of the people that I work with it's key to get you right into working on your credit right away. So you can get all those late payments removed and get your credit dialed back in. So you're able to continue on and kind of start your life over. And if you want to own a house again, you can do that. But what, what do you think you need to get started again, get back on your feet, get into a rental, things like that. What are you, what are you looking for? Well, do you think you can actually do this quick enough that this would not affect my credit? It's already going to affect your credit for sure. But can we do it quick enough so you don't have an actual full blown foreclosure on your credit? Yes. Or a bankruptcy. If you haven't filed one, yes, we can get that done and get this all wrapped up. So you don't have, so the bank doesn't foreclose. We can prevent the bank from foreclosing if we get there in time and the numbers all work for everybody. Yes. I'm thinking 60,000. So you think that you need 60,000, right? Yes. That's what you're saying. Okay. So if we look at the amount owed on the house, which is around 192, and then we look at the, the arrearages that need to be paid up, that's another $30,000. That's going to take us up to 222. And then the repairs about $20,000 in repairs. That's going to take us up to about $242,000. Now, if we added another 60,000 on top of that, now we're up over $300,000 and the property in great shape is only worth 330. So with, with those numbers, honestly, you're not even going to be able to list it with an agent and sell it because the agent wouldn't say you don't have enough equity here. So realistically, realistically, realistically speaking, I wouldn't be able to step in and help at something like that. It's just, it wouldn't be doable, especially, I mean, we're five weeks out and you know, the numbers have to work for us to step in and play that kind of ball. Cause we're going to have to bring in our cash assets to do this. So there's a bit of risk involved in this short of a timeframe. Do you really think you need 60 K or could you do better than that? What was your number? I don't have a number. What I'm trying to do is help you. So I am, I'm interested in buying the property, but I work with a lot of people in foreclosure and there are a lot, a lot more than you would imagine, but I'm here to help, but I can only help so many people. And in the spirit of that, it needs to make sense for us too, because I have investors that I work with that put up the money for me to, to work these situations out with people. So it, it isn't, I don't have a number. I know I have an idea of what I need to make this work, but I also need to do more homework. But if, if the numbers aren't even close, then it just isn't going to work for either one of us. I need to know realistically what you think you need instead of, instead of ending up with a foreclosure on your credit and literally nothing in your pocket. And they're going to, come and evict you from the house, which is a horrible situation. I've seen it happen. Instead, we need to be realistic about the situation. You're five weeks out from a foreclosure sale, losing the house, losing any dollars at all that you would get back. So realistically, what, what can work for you to get back on your feet and get a fresh start and get this thing out of your hair? Yeah, I mean, well, I have to be able to rent a place that I have my dog. He's 12 and he's 65 pounds. And so I really can't rent an apartment. So I would need like a small house to rent. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So. I mean, I think you want to do the right thing. So maybe. If we just. Move forward and. Could see what really the numbers could be. Still. So that's a little bit more. So what do you owe in taxes? Just a little property taxes. Yeah. It's the property taxes. Yeah. He wasn't paying them and I didn't know it. So that's. About 5,300, maybe 5,400 at the most. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So. We have to tack that on too, because that. The County must get paid before anybody else, actually. So that we got to put that right on the, right on the top of the total numbers too. Right. So. Go ahead. No, it's okay. Go ahead. I'm just trying to think this through. Yeah. So, so realistically, if we look at the numbers and like I said, coming in at the property. We're going to be paying the property taxes. So we're going to have to do the repairs. And we're going to have to verify that with the bank. You know, that might be a little bit different. You might be spot on, but. Let's say you own one 92 and then the back payment, the arrears. And then the repairs. So now we're up there and now we got to add the taxes onto that. We might have. So let's say we purchase this property. We're going to have holding costs associated with it because we're going to have to do the repairs. You say it needs 20 can repairs. And then we're going to have to pay the mortgage and everything else. So we're going to have to do a lot of different things. And that might take us a couple of months to do that. So now we're paying payments on the money that we brought in. To cure the mortgage and everything else and fix the issue. So. You see how we have, we have multiple costs too. And then on the backside. We, we need to make some kind of revenue when we resell this property. So what our goal is, is to, is to come in. Fix up the property, get it back in, in great shape. And then either rent the house, you know, hold it ourselves and rent it, or we're going to resell it. That's going to take time and money for us to do. So we have to factor that in as well. And then if we use agents, you know, agents are. It's going to cost us 6%. If we sell it, if we use agents and that right there is, you know, 20, some thousand dollars, right. Right off of our bottom line. So you can see how the numbers really start to change. It isn't. Oh, the house is worth this and I owe this. And that's the difference. And, and there's all of this equity there. It just doesn't work that way in real estate, unfortunately, because there are all kinds of costs involved. And you probably experienced that if you've dug around a little bit regarding this deal, and you might've thought about selling it with an agent and found that, oh my gosh, this is going to cost a lot of money. And then I have to sit and wait and hope that somebody buys it. And if they don't, it's going to go to sale. So I'm no better off. So I'm here with the opportunity to help you. We don't have to worry about, you know, a buyer saying, I like the house and then they back out on the last day and this goes to foreclosure sale and you live that on everything. So I'm here to help you out, but it needs to make sense for everyone. And like I said, I want to get you a fresh start. I want to, I want you to be able to get into a place, you know, you, you have your income, right? You have your, you have your job where you make income, right? Yes. Okay. So you have that going for you. So you're able to afford rent. I want to help you get into your next place. I want to help you with moving, you know, so you can get some movers to help you. You don't have to pack all this stuff up yourself. I want to help you do all this. So, you know, a really large number just doesn't make sense, but something realistic where again, you're going to get a fresh start and this thing is going to go away and all of the back payments and everything else, you're going to be able to forget completely about that and not worry about it again. You get a fresh start. So that's what I'm looking for is more of a realistic number from you. So it makes sense for me to step in and make this happen. Do you think you could do it for 35, if I was able to stay here three more weeks to try and get to a new place? I tell you what I think. I think what a good idea is, is for me to take these numbers that, that you have given me about the property and let me do some homework. I can do it pretty quickly. Let me do some homework on my side and really dial in the numbers. Look at, look at the stats on the property. I can pull it up here in County records, look at the stats on the property, really look at the comparables like what's selling in your area and what the, what the value is. Let me look at those numbers and see what I can do. And let's touch base again. You know, it's 6 30 now. Are you around tomorrow around 11? Yes. Okay. I'll wait for you to call. Okay. So let's do that. And I think I have your email. It's a Mac three, eight, two, four at Gmail. Right. That one, the best one would be it's actually S D Mac. Okay. Super. So I got that written down and then this is your best number that we're on right now, right? Yes. Yes. That's the, that's the phone number. The one we're talking on now. All right. I think we have potential here, Shannon. And like I said, I, I do this a lot. I worked with a lot of people and I I've been, I've been doing this for a long time and I have my own story with foreclosures. So I know what it's like. I'd love to work with you. I'd love to work this out and I think we have potential. So let me, let me run the numbers on my side and get back with you at 11 tomorrow and we will see what we can put together. Sound good. Thank you, David. I do appreciate this. Okay. Thanks Shannon. Have a good night. Good night. Okay. See ya. Bye-bye."
